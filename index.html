        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy <b>text of the printing and typesetting industry</b>. <i>Lorem Ipsum </i>has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. <em>It has survived not only five centuries</em>, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. <br/>
        It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
